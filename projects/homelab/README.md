# Home Lab Personal Cloud ☁️

## Overview
Home Lab is my personal cloud and homelab setup—a hybrid infrastructure combining a Raspberry Pi cluster with a virtual private server (VPS) for enhanced capabilities. It’s a playground for learning cloud computing, networking, and DevOps practices while hosting real-world services. This infrastructure powers everything from media streaming to custom apps, with **Jellyfin** as a key use case within the same infrastructure for self-hosted media.

## What It Does
Home Lab powers a variety of services across media, monitoring, and utilities:
- **Media Streaming**: Self-hosted solution for movies, shows, and music with a user-friendly interface (starting with Jellyfin).
- **Dashboards**: Centralized monitoring for system health and network status.
- **AI Utilities & Tools**: Experimental scripts, automation, web tools, and apps—all built and hosted on this infrastructure.

## Tech Stack
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi cluster + VPS for distributed workloads.
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose for service isolation and scalability.
- **Networking**: Secure tunneling and reverse proxying for safe remote access.
- **Automation**: Scripts and configurations to streamline deployment and updates.

## Key Features
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines low-cost local hardware with cloud resources for redundancy and performance.
- **Secure Access**: Uses VPNs and modern web servers for encrypted, reliable connections.
- **Scalable Design**: Modular setup allowing easy addition of new services or nodes.

## Why I Built It
I wanted a sandbox to experiment with real-world cloud concepts—virtualization, container orchestration, and secure networking—while running useful services for personal use. Starting with media streaming via Jellyfin, I was inspired to expand after building my own custom tunneling solutions, which led to hosting more—AI experiments, custom scripts, web tools, and apps. Home Lab is a living project that evolves as I explore new technologies.

## Lessons Learned
- Balancing resource constraints on edge devices with cloud power.
- Implementing secure remote access without exposing infrastructure.
- Automating multi-service deployments for consistency.
